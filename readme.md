Readme documentation needs, some guidelines:

An overview of your project’s structure and main modules/purposes.
Basic usage and code examples for how a user or developer would interact with your new features.
Any setup steps (especially regarding virtual environments, dependencies, or environment variables).
Explanation of your type constants or lists, and how users should pass/types to your count-querying methods.
Any non-obvious complexities—such as why some object types need different handling.
Guidance on code formatting, especially now that you’re adopting Black’s line-length setting.
