# Accept a list of types in your method—defaulting to “all” if none are passed.
# Example: get_counts(types=None) where None means ALL_TYPES.
# This lets you support all use cases elegantly: single, some, or all types.
# Document your supported types in an (internal or public) constant so users can introspect and call with confidence.
# Internally, loop over the provided types and perform the queries as needed.
# Optionally, provide simple wrappers for common cases if you find you or other users frequently request certain groups.
